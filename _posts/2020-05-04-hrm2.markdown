I had the great pleasure of writing a first article on QED in a publication called Human Readable Magazine, a kind of New Yorker for coders.

So as the subject I chose QED's core principle: type/function equivalence. The article explains what it is, the rationale behind using it and a few extra features it allows.

Space being limited, more extra features are coming up in a second article to be published soon.
