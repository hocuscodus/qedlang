The QED language now has a dedicated website, [qed-lang.org](http://qed-lang.org). You may now have a glance of what QED does best looking at its [online demo page](http://qed-lang.org/demos). This page will also continuously showcase all QED improvements and latest features. Documentation will be laid out here so developers know in full detail what QED really is and what it can do (a simple ["Get started" section](http://qed-lang.org/qedintro) is here now). Also, there will be posts that regularly inform users regarding QED latest news.

QED is a nascent language so as it grows, this website will grow as well.

So, welcome folks!
