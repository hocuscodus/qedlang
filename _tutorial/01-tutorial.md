If you really want to jump straight to the gist of QED, you may very well skip to the far end of this section. Suffice it to say that QED syntax is mostly inspired by C. You may come back to this section anytime for specific details.
* If possible, you should start with [implicit arrays]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/implicit-arrays), followed by QED classes, which are used in different scenarios compared to most mainstream languages and are a solid foundation to GUIs.
* If you can't wait to explore the UI stuff now, go [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/qed-ui). You should understand most of it but may want to further study implicit arrays and QED classes afterwards to gain a more solid background.

Before detailing what makes QED different from other languages, let's first show the similarities to get ready for the GUI and other novelties with a firm ground. The QED syntax borrows heavily from the C syntax.

The goal of this tutorial is to give you a good feel of what QED really is.
